<h1>Balls of Fire in the Sky</h1>
<h2>Sign of the Apocalypse or just Random Anomilies?</h2>
<h3></h3>
<p>Question:
What causes fireballs in the sky?

Answer:




 </p>

<ul>
  <li>Fireballs were much in the news over the past month due to a big one that was seen in the Illinois, Michigan, and Indiana areas around local midnight on March 26 - 27, 2003. The fireball streaked across the sky and exploded in a bright flash. But just what causes the fireball, and how often do they occur?</li>
    <li>Fireballs are really just big meteors - the result of meteoroids falling into the Earth's atmosphere and burning up. The rock that caused the "Chicago Fireball", as the March 2003 event has been called, was probably a small space rock about 1 or 2 meters wide. As it fell into the atmosphere, it heated up and eventually broke up into about 500 fragments. These fragments fell to the ground striking houses, cars, and roads -- but no people.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Fireballs and meteors are common events. An object about one meter in diameter or larger strikes Earth's atmosphere about 40 times per year.</li>
    <li>Few are seen, however, because the fireballs usually appear over unpopulated areas rather than over major cities like Chicago.</li>
